This branch mainly deals with the generation transmission and effective utilization of electricity, the design and operation of various electrical machines their performance analysis control techniques etc. Design and estimation of LV,HV and EHV electrical installation is another area of the course.
                        Detailed study from the basics of Electronics Engineering up to power electronic devices included in syllabus enhances the realization of control techniques with the elimination of conventional bulky components. Adequate sill acquired in the preparation of drawing in CAD and the control techniques using different modern controllers brought a very wide opportunity of students for placement in production sector and related software developing area.  Beyond the scope of supervisory cadre posting ,assistant engineer, sub engineer, production engineer ,quality control officer in various public and private enterprises are some of the remarkable opportunities in addition to that of diploma students in any other discipline.</span></p>
